# Portfolio Starter — Parth Suri (PSURI1894)

> A ready-to-use repository template to showcase your projects, skills, and internship work. Tailored for Parth Suri (PSURI1894) based on your existing GitHub activity (webdev, backend, VIT internship projects).

---

## Why this repo

This repository is designed to be the one-stop portfolio that ties together your existing projects (`webdev-mini-project`, `travel_hub_backend`, `VIT-Internship-Project`, `Hackathon`) and presents them professionally to recruiters, collaborators, and hackathon judges. It focuses on:

* Clear, modern README and landing page
* Live demos / hosted links (Netlify / Vercel / Render) for frontends and backends
* Code examples and quick-start guides so others can run your projects locally
* A consistent folder structure for future projects

---

## Suggested repository name

**`portfolio-starter`**
(Or `psuri-portfolio`, `parth-suri-portfolio`, whichever you prefer.)
